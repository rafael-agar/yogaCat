            <h3>WHO SHOULD APPLY</h3>
            <p>Anyone who is looking to deepen their practice and knowledge of yoga. The biggest barrier that many yogis face is the “teaching” part of teacher training. This training is for those of you who want to teach AND those of you who just have a desire to deepen your practice. Yoga teacher training is about personal awareness and development and expanding your knowledge of yoga, so your practice is enhanced and so is your life. Please note: All skill levels are invited to enroll in yoga teacher training, so don’t stress if you don’t have yoga experience.
              <br><br>
            Terrie and Suzanne are committed to helping you succeed based on what is important to you and will support your growth every step of your yoga teacher training journey. </p>
              <br>
            <h3>WHAT WILL I BE CERTIFIED TO TEACH? </h3>
            <p>Our methodology will prepare you to teach CYFlow and CY26 classes. The fundamentals of other styles such as Ashtanga and Restorative Yoga are also covered. You will be provided a CYFlow and CY26 sequence to learn and teach but you will also be empowered to create your own. This training is designed to give you teaching framework, but importantly to help you develop your own unique voice and teaching style.
              <br><br>
            We are a Yoga Alliance Registered Yoga School and our curriculum meets the guidelines set forth by Yoga Alliance for 200-hour yoga teacher training. Upon the completion of your training, you can register with Yoga Alliance as a RYT-200. This designation will allow you to seek teaching positions at yoga studios, gyms and other facilities that offer yoga classes. </p>

            <h3>HOW TO PREPARE FOR TRAINING</h3>
            <p>You are strongly encouraged to regularly attend yoga classes and to try different teachers. There will be some required reading, so all articles and books will be posted by mid-January. You can best prepare for training by purchasing the required books and getting familiar with them prior to the start of teacher training.
            <br><br>
            Prior to the start of training you will receive a full onboarding email which will include:</p>
            <ul>

            <h3>Cat YOGA 200-HOUR TRAINING LEADS</h3>
            <p>Lead Trainer: Suzanne Bergen - Yoga Instructor - E-RYT 200
              <br><br>
              One of Cat Yoga’s founding teachers, Suzanne Bergen (E-RYT® 200) creates a safe space for healing for her students through the practice of yoga. It is her goal for her students to feel a sense of empowerment that translates both on and off the mat.
              <br><br>
              Since beginning her yoga journey in 1993, she’s been recognized as “Cat’s Most Moving Instructor” by ClassPass and has completed an impressive number of trainings, including:
              <br><br>
              <ul>
                 <li>200-hour Power Yoga Teacher Training, Grace Morales</li>
                  <li>Hot 26TM Yoga Teacher Training, Grace Morales</li>
                  <li>40-hour Power Yoga Training & Immersion, Bryan Kest</li>
                  <li>40-hour Spirit Speaks, Seane Corn</li>
              </ul>
                  
              <br>
              Giving back is important to Suzanne. For five years, she has been the race director of the Stephen Siller Tunnel to Towers Foundation Stair Climb in Cat, held at the Duke Energy Building each April. Participation in the climb has increased by 400% since 2016 under her leadership. An avid stair climber herself, Suzanne is ranked top 10 nationally for the sport.
              <br><br>
              In a previous life, Suzanne was a Director of Sales and Marketing at a midtown Manhattan hotel. She met her husband Joe in the northeast and they, together with their triplet sons, moved to Cat in 1997.
              <br><br>
              Suzanne welcomes newcomers and seasoned yogis alike to her classes.</p>

            Terrie is the Founder of Empower Health America (EHA), an evidence-based change management company that launched in November 2014. She works with individual, teams and organizations and provides the following services:

            Organization Development Consulting | Personal Development Coaching | Empowerment Programs | Workshops and Retreats | Mindfulness and Resiliency Training | Proprietary Train For Life® Assessment | Customized Empowerment Campaigns and Online Educational Programs and Resources
            <br><br>
            Terrie’s yoga journey began in 1999, thanks to Grace Morales, one of Cat’s first yoga teachers and the Founder of Cat Yoga. She started practicing Ashtanga in a tiny heated room while listening to David Swenson on tape and in 2000 she started teaching Hot 26 classes for Grace at Cat Yoga. From that moment on, she knew she had found a new passion…teaching yoga. Terrie has a smashup fitness background including, dance, gymnastics, competitive aerobics, martial arts, and has taught about every type of organized exercise class possible, to include providing over two decades of personal training.
            <br><br>
            Terrie shares her love for yoga in this statement. “Yoga is moving meditation to me and I feel grateful every time I get to guide one person or 100 people through a yoga practice. Yoga is a journey of the heart, mind and body. There is no end…just new possibilities every time you roll out your mat.”
            <br><br>
            Terrie reflects on her yoga journey and gives credit to all the yogis who have influenced her along the way. “I am blessed to be a teacher but value the importance of being a student as well, so I respectfully give credit to the many wonderful teachers that have inspired and influenced me over the years. Grace Morales, Johnna Smith, Suzanne Bergen, Tanner Bazemore, Baron Baptiste, Brian Kest, Shiva Rea and (Kancho) Cameron Shayne and the teacher that lives inside of me.”
            <br><br>
            “The desire to grow requires an open heart and an open mind.”
